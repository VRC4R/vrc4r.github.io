		<h1>Who are you?!</h1>
		<p>Hi! You can call me VRCAR.<p>
		<p>I have a sort of facsination with older versions of software, VRChat included. A little over a year ago (April 2021) I indulged in this fascination, looking through archives of VRChat's website and Graham Gaylor's blog just for fun. During my "studies", I found that a good chunk of pre-Steam VRChat builds were <i>still being hosted online, on their original hosts!</i> This got me excited, but I was too busy to channel that excitement and put it to good use, so I recorded my findings in a text file and stowed it away for a while.</p>
		<p>A few months ago, I rediscovered that text file, and that spark of excitement reappeared with a new goal: <b>to archive as many VRChat clients and SDKs as I could find.</b> I looked through VRChat's site archives to find existing links to clients, used their filenames to find other clients, discovered the existence of beta/"unstable" clients & tried to find as many of those as I could, too. (I had to work with open directories that had closed directory LISTINGS.) After hours of looking through archives and guessing filenames, I ended up with a pretty extensive list of clients, and archived them all via the Wayback Machine.</p>
		<p>That brings us to today, May 22nd, 2022. At the time of writing, I am uploading all the clients I've found onto the Internet Archive, version by version. I don't quite know what this site is going to turn into yet, but for now, it'll serve as this small "About" page you see here. I plan to share the rest of my findings in one form or another in the future, whether it be on this website or otherwise.</p>
		<p>If you have any questions, would like to share any findings of your own, or simply would like to get in contact with me, you can reach me at <a href="mailto:vrcar@riseup.net">vrcar@riseup.net</a>. Ciao!</p>
